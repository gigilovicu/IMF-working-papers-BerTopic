# Topic modelling of IMF working papers using BerTopic algorithm

We analyse the Fund’s research with respect to the Working Paper series. We use a topic modelling approach built on the embeddings from the popular BERT transformer architecture. Overall, the topic model produces a set of detailed coherent topics that summarise IMF research over the past 30 years. These topics are robust to several variations of the Working Paper corpus (using paper summaries, titles and subject tags). Many topics relate to issues firmly within the IMF’s remit, such as exchange rates, monetary policy, economic growth and development and reform (e.g. related to labour markets, demography and pensions). However, over the past 10 years contemporary social issues have also gained prominence in IMF research. This is reflected in a surge in research about topics like inequality, climate change and more recently COVID-19, to the extent that these are some of the most popular topics of IMF research over the past 30 years.
